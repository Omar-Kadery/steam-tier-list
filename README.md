# Steam Tier List

Simple app I built while learning Svelte. Input SteamId and it generates a tier list where you can rank all your games. Pretty sure it needs your profile to be public. Uses [svelte-dnd](https://github.com/isaacHagoel/svelte-dnd-action).

It makes calls to [Steam Tier List Server](https://github.com/Omar-Kadery/steam-tier-list-server) which is a basic C# backend hosted on my DigitalOcean account, which is completely unnecessary but a good learning experience for me :)
