# Steam Tier List

Simple app I built while learning Svelte. Input SteamId and it generates a tier list where you can rank all your games. Pretty sure it needs your profile to be public. Uses [svelte-dnd](https://github.com/isaacHagoel/svelte-dnd-action).

Needs [Steam Tier List Server](https://github.com/Omar-Kadery/steam-tier-list-server).

**Prerequisites:**
- An **[API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey)** for your Steam account
- The **[Steam64ID](https://steamid.io/lookup)** for your Steam account
